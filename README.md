## Abstract

This study proposes a lightweight autonomous agent framework based on the ReAct paradigm, designed to solve complex tasks through adaptive decision-making and multi-agent collaboration. Unlike traditional frameworks that generate fixed workflows in advance, this framework dynamically decides the next move during execution based solely on the current state. To address the issue of inappropriate termination that may result from adaptive execution paths, a novel abandonment strategy based on a probabilistic penalty mechanism is introduced. Additionally, to enable multi-agent collaboration, a memory-passing mechanism is introduced, allowing agents to share and dynamically update memories. The framework decomposes complex tasks into sub-tasks and plans their execution order and required capabilities according to the agents' abilities, enhancing task execution efficiency and relevance. The innovative abandonment algorithm dynamically adjusts the agent's task abandonment probability via a probabilistic penalty mechanism. By tuning the algorithm's hyperparameters, the agent's execution strategy can be balanced between conservative and exploratory tendencies, significantly improving adaptability and efficiency in complex environments. Moreover, the framework's modular design and tool-learning technology support flexible extensibility and ease of use, enabling customization and optimization based on actual needs. Agents can enhance their functionality using external tools and improve tool usage effectiveness through continuous learning and optimization. The multi-agent collaboration mechanism, with clear division and cooperation, allows each agent to focus on specific task parts, significantly boosting execution efficiency and quality.

## Experiments

The experimental results demonstrate that the `ceo-py` framework significantly outperforms `autogen` and `langchain` in handling tasks of varying complexity, especially in multi-step tasks with possible failures.

| Framework   | Version | Model                                      | one-step-task | multi-step-task | multi-step-task-with-possible-failure |
| ------ | --- |----------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |

- `one-step-task`: Tasks that can be completed with a single tool call.
- `multi-step-task`: Tasks that require multiple tool calls to complete, with no possibility of tool failure.
- `multi-step-task-with-possible-failure`: Tasks that require multiple tool calls to complete, where tools may fail, requiring the agent to retry and correct errors.

> The deepseek-v3 model is not supported by `autogen-agentchat==0.4.9.2`.

## Installation

- From [PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/ceo-py/)

    ```shell
    pip install ceo-py
    ```

- From [Github](https://github.com/vortezwohl/CEO/releases)

    Download .whl first then run

    ```shell
    pip install ./ceo_py-x.x.x-py3-none-any.whl
    ```

## Quick Start

To start building your own agent, follow the steps listed.

1. set environmental variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`

    ```
    # .env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
    ```

2. bring in SDKs from `CEO`

    - `Agent` lets you instantiate an agent.

    - `Personality` is an enumeration class used for customizing personalities of agents.

        - `Personality.PRUDENT` makes the agent's behavior more cautious.

        - `Personality.INQUISITIVE` encourages the agent to be more proactive in trying and exploring.

    - `get_openai_model` gives you a `BaseChatModel` as thought engine.

    - `@ability(brain: BaseChatModel, cache: bool = True, cache_dir: str = '')` is a decorator which lets you declare a function as an `Ability`.

    - `@agentic(agent: Agent)` is a decorator which lets you declare a function as an `AgenticAbility`.

    ```python
    from ceo import (
        Agent,
        Personality,
        get_openai_model,
        ability,
        agentic
    )
    ```

3. declare functions as basic abilities

    ```python
    @ability
    def calculator(expr: str) -> float:
        # this function only accepts a single math expression
        return simplify(expr)

    @ability
    def write_file(filename: str, content: str) -> str:
        with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            f.write(content)
        return f'{content} written to {filename}.'
    ```

4. instantiate an agent

    You can grant abilities to agents while instantiating them.

    ```python
    model = get_openai_model()
    agent = Agent(abilities=[calculator, write_file], brain=model, name='CEO', personality=Personality.INQUISITIVE)
    ```

    - You can also grant more abilities to agents later:

        ```python
        agent.grant_ability(calculator)
        ```

        or

        ```python
        agent.grant_abilities([calculator])
        ```

    - To deprive abilities:

        ```python
        agent.deprive_ability(calculator)
        ```

        or

        ```python
        agent.deprive_abilities([calculator])
        ```
    
    You can change an agent's personality using method `change_personality(personality: Personality)`

    ```python
    agent.change_personality(Personality.PRUDENT)
    ```

5. assign a request to your agent

    ```python
    agent.assign("Here is a sphere with radius of 9.5 cm and pi here is 3.14159, find the area and volume respectively then write the results into a file called 'result.txt'.")
    ```

6. leave the rest to your agent

    ```python
    response = agent.just_do_it()
    print(response)
    ```

> `ceo` also supports multi-agent collaboration scenario, declare a function as agent calling ability with `@agentic(agent: Agent)`, then grant it to an agent. [See example](#multi-agent).

## Observability

To make the working process of agents observable, I provide two hooks, namely `BeforeActionTaken` and `AfterActionTaken`. 
They allow you to observe and intervene in the decision-making and execution results of each step of the agent's actions. 
You can obtain and modify the agent's decision results for the next action through the `BeforeActionTaken` hook, 
while `AfterActionTaken` allows you to obtain and modify the execution results of the actions (the tampered execution results will be part of the agent's memory).

To start using hooks, follow the steps listed.

1. bring in hooks and messages from `CEO`

    ```python
    from ceo.brain.hook import BeforeActionTaken, AfterActionTaken
    from ceo.message import BeforeActionTakenMessage, AfterActionTakenMessage
    ```

2. declare functions and encapsulate them as hooks

    ```python
    def before_action_taken(agent: Agent, message: BeforeActionTakenMessage):
        print(f'Agent: {agent.name}, Next move: {message}')
        return message

    def after_action_taken(agent: Agent, message: AfterActionTakenMessage):
        print(f'Agent: {agent.name}, Action taken: {message}')
        return message

    before_action_taken_hook = BeforeActionTaken(before_action_taken)
    after_action_taken_hook = AfterActionTaken(after_action_taken)
    ```

    > In these two hook functions, you intercepted the message and printed the information in the message. 
    Afterwards, you returned the message unaltered to the agent. 
    Of course, you also have the option to **modify** the information in the message, 
    thereby achieving intervention in the agent's working process.

3. use hooks during the agent's working process

    ```python
    agent.assign(...).just_do_it(before_action_taken_hook, after_action_taken_hook)
    ```

On the other hand, Taylor's capability is to create and write files. For operations involving interaction with the external file system, I want him to be more cautious, so Taylor's personality is set to `Personality.PRUDENT`.
